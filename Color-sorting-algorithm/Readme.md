# Purpose
The purpose of this program is to seperate 2 different colors, in a similar way to populations. The program determines if a specific space wants to move based on the identity of their immedate neighbors. If the space determines it should move it moves to an empty (white) space, wich it selects at random from all avalble empty spaces.

# Partners
This program was made over the course of a week with help from another programer from my school Adriana Jergusova
